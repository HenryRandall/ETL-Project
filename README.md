# ETL-Project

The project must use two or more sources of data.
  * Two recommended sources are [data.world](https://data.world/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
  * Google also has a dataset search interface: [https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch).
  * Alternatively, the group can use APIs or scrape datafro the web. However, please run it by the instructional staff
Once datasets are identified, students will perform ETL on the data, and document the following in a technical report:
  * Datasets used and their sources
  * Types of data wrangling performed, such as data cleaning, joining, filtering, and aggregating.
  * The schemata used in the final production database, whether relational or non-relational.
* Finally, each group should have ideally two, no more than three, students.
